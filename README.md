# Student-Score-Prediction-Model
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that predicts student scores based on historical data. The model will be built using Python's scikit-learn library and evaluated using appropriate metrics. Here, I have used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.


## Key Features:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn library
- Implementation of multi-Linear Regression
- Evaluation metrics: MSE(Mean Squared Error)


## Getting Started:

- Run a Jupyter Notebook and install Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and scikit-learn on your devices.
- Install StudentScorePrediction.ipynb and deploy.py from this github repository.
## Results:

Achieved Mean Squared error of 4.26491741107721 and model score of 0.9888368725061238
